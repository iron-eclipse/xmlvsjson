I will begin by analyzing the JSON schema to understand the structure and elements of the contract.

JSON Schema:
```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "contract": {
      "type": "object",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

The schema describes a single "contract" object with various properties, including parties, offer and acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations, legality of purpose, certainty of terms, consent, duration and termination, signatures, etc.

Identifying the main sections and subsections:

1. **Parties**: This section will include information about the consultant, commission, and any other relevant parties.
2. **Offer and Acceptance**: This section will describe the offer made by one party to another and the acceptance of that offer.
3. **Consideration**: This section will outline what is being offered in consideration for something else (e.g., services rendered).
4. **Intention to Create Legal Relations**: This section will confirm the parties' intent to create legal relations through this contract.
5. **Legality of Purpose**: This section will ensure that the purpose or objective of the contract is lawful and legitimate.
6. **Certainty of Terms**: This section will establish clear, certain terms for the duration of the contract.
7. **Consent**: This section will confirm that all parties have given their consent to enter into this contract.
8. **Duration and Termination**: This section will outline the start and end dates for the contract as well as any termination clauses.
9. **Signatures**: This final section will include the signatures of all parties involved in the contract.

Scratchpad:

- Main sections:
	+ Parties
	+ Offer and Acceptance
	+ Consideration
	+ Intention to Create Legal Relations
	+ Legality of Purpose
	+ Certainty of Terms
	+ Consent
	+ Duration and Termination
	+ Signatures

Now that we have analyzed the schema and identified the main sections, let's move on to extracting relevant information from the JSON document.

JSON Document:
```
{
  "json_output": {
    ...
  }
}
```

We will focus on extracting data related to parties, complete agreement text, notification, and complete agreement including attachments.
