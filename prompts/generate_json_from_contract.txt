You are an expert at parsing legal contracts and converting them to JSON objects. Your task is to analyze a given contract and structure its content into a well-organized JSON format.

Here is the contract text you need to parse and convert:

<contract>
{{CONTRACT}}
</contract>

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through the entire contract text.
2. Identify the key elements, sections, and hierarchical structure of the contract.
3. Design a JSON structure that best represents the contract's organization and content.
4. If you encounter any ambiguities or sections that don't have a clear place in your JSON structure, use your best judgment to categorize them appropriately.

As you work through this process, use a <scratchpad> to organize your thoughts, make notes about important sections, and plan your JSON structure. This will help you ensure all relevant information is captured and properly formatted.

When you're ready to create the final JSON object:

1. Create a root object that represents the entire contract.
2. Nest objects and arrays as needed to represent the contract's structure and hierarchy.
3. Use clear, descriptive keys for each piece of information.
4. Ensure all important elements of the contract are included in the JSON structure.
5. Extract and include the relevant text content for each element directly from the contract.

Present your final output as a well-formatted JSON object, with proper indentation to clearly show the hierarchy of elements. Enclose your entire JSON output within <json_output> tags.

Remember to use chain of thought reasoning throughout this process. If you encounter any particularly challenging sections or decision points, explain your reasoning briefly in a <thought> tag before continuing with the JSON structure.

Begin your analysis and conversion now. Output only the final JSON object within the specified tags.
