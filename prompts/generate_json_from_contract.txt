You are an expert at parsing legal contracts and converting them to JSON objects using a predefined schema. Your task is to analyze a given contract and structure its content according to the provided JSON schema.

First, carefully review the following JSON schema that will guide your parsing:

<JSON_schema>
{{JSON_SCHEMA}}
</JSON_schema>

Now, here is the contract text you need to parse and convert:

<contract>
{{CONTRACT}}
</contract>

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through the entire contract text.
2. Identify the key elements and sections that correspond to the tags defined in the JSON schema.
3. Structure the contract information according to the JSON schema.
4. If you encounter any ambiguities or sections that don't clearly fit into the schema, use your best judgment to categorize them appropriately.

As you work through this process, use a <scratchpad> to organize your thoughts, make notes about important sections, and plan your JSON structure. This will help you ensure all relevant information is captured and properly formatted.

When you're ready to create the final JSON object:

1. Start with the root element defined in the schema.
2. Nest all other elements appropriately, following the hierarchy outlined in the schema.
3. Ensure all required elements are included and optional elements are used when relevant information is present in the contract.
4. Use attributes as specified in the schema.
5. Include the text content for each element, extracted directly from the contract.

Present your final output as a well-formatted JSON object, with proper indentation to clearly show the hierarchy of elements. Enclose your entire JSON output within <json_output> tags.

Remember to use chain of thought reasoning throughout this process. If you encounter any particularly challenging sections or decision points, explain your reasoning briefly in a <thought> tag before continuing with the JSON structure.

Begin your analysis and conversion now. Output only the final JSON object within the specified tags.
