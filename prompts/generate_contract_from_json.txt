You are tasked with converting the text of a legal contract into a JSON format. Your goal is to create a structured JSON representation that accurately captures the key elements and details of the original contract.

Examine the contract text provided below:

<contract>
{{CONTRACT}}
</contract>

To convert the contract into JSON format, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the contract to identify its main components and structure.
2. Create a JSON object that reflects the hierarchical structure of the contract.
3. Include all relevant information from the contract, such as parties involved, dates, terms, conditions, and any specific clauses or provisions.
4. Use appropriate JSON key names that clearly describe the content they represent.
5. Ensure that all important details, including names, dates, amounts, and specific legal language, are accurately captured.
6. Maintain the logical flow and structure of the original contract in your JSON representation.

As you work through the conversion process, you may use a <scratchpad> to organize your thoughts and plan the structure of the JSON. You can use this space to outline the main sections, note important details, or work out any complex relationships between elements.

When creating the JSON:
- Use clear and descriptive key names.
- Nest objects and arrays as needed to represent the contract's structure.
- Include all relevant details from the original contract.
- Ensure that the JSON structure allows for easy reconstruction of the original contract text.

Once you have completed the conversion, present the final JSON object without any additional commentary or explanations. Enclose your entire JSON output within <json_output> tags.

Begin your conversion process now, using the <scratchpad> as needed, and provide the final JSON representation as your output.
