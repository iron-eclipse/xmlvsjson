You are tasked with reconstructing the text of a legal contract based on an XML schema (XSD) and a corresponding XML document. The XML schema describes the characteristics of the contract, while the XML document contains the specific details of an actual contract. Your goal is to recreate the original contract text as accurately as possible.

First, carefully review the provided XML schema:

<xml_schema>
{{XML_SCHEMA}}
</xml_schema>

Now, examine the XML document containing the specific contract details:

<xml_document>
{{XML_DOCUMENT}}
</xml_document>

To reconstruct the contract text, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the XML schema to understand the structure and elements of the contract.
2. Identify the main sections and subsections of the contract based on the schema.
3. Extract the relevant information from the XML document, matching it to the corresponding elements in the schema.
4. Use the extracted information to reconstruct each section of the contract in a logical order.
5. Ensure that all required elements are included and properly formatted.
6. Pay attention to any conditional elements or attributes that may affect the contract's content.

As you work through the reconstruction process, use a <scratchpad> to organize your thoughts and plan the structure of the contract. You may use this space to list the main sections, note important details, or work out any complex relationships between elements.

When reconstructing the contract text:
- Use appropriate legal language and formatting.
- Include all relevant details from the XML document.
- Maintain a logical flow and structure based on the schema.
- Ensure that all parties, dates, amounts, and other specific information are accurately represented.

Once you have completed the reconstruction, present the final contract text without any additional commentary or explanations. The output should resemble a standard legal contract as closely as possible.

Begin your reconstruction process now, using the <scratchpad> as needed, and provide the final reconstructed contract text as your output.
