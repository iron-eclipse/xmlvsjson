KNOW YOUR SUPPLIER
Aid agencies should hold sufficient information about the circumstances and business
of their supplier (in this case financial service provider) and its beneficial owners to
inform their risk assessment processes, and thus manage their money laundering and
terrorist financing risks effectively.
The information about a hawala agent or MSB that they should consider obtaining as part of
their risk assessment includes:
Maturity of the business, and its owners’ experience
It is relevant to consider whether or not the MSB is a new or established operation, the level of
experience the management and those running the business have in this type of activity, and
whether or not providing money services are the customer’s primary, or an ancillary, business.
Location(s) and market(s) served
Money laundering risks within an MSB can vary widely depending on the locations, customer
bases, and markets served. Relevant considerations include whether markets served are
domestic or international, or whether services are targeted to local residents or to broad
markets.
It is important to know and understand any associations the MSB may have with other
jurisdictions (headquarters, operating facilities, branches, subsidiaries, etc.) and the individuals
who may influence its operations (political connections, etc.). A visit to the place of business
may be helpful to confirm the existence and activities of the entity.
Ownership and control
In deciding who the beneficial owner is in relation to a customer who is not a private individual,
the objective must be to know who has ownership or control over the funds which form or
otherwise relate to the relationship, and/or form the controlling mind and/or management of any
legal entity involved in the funds.
*Guide for how to interpret: ‘highest reasonable standard of diligence’
The following questions should be used to guide the conversation with the agent when an aid
agency is establishing whether he is an appropriate partner.
(1) Agent selection: who is your agent at the pay-out destination? How long have you been
dealing with them? Is this an established relationship (i.e. are you related to them or have
you conducted long-standing business with this person), or a new relationship?
(2) Payment method: how do you settle payment with your agents? By cash courier; trade;
bank; third party settlement?
(3) Human resources: will you use your own resources, or will you outsource some of the
assignment? What is your capacity, and the acocuntability built into other relationships?
(4) Working capital: what is your average transaction size, and your largest?
