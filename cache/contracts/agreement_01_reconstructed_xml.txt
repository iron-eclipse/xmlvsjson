Based on the provided XML schema and document, I will reconstruct the contract text as accurately as possible. Here's my scratchpad to organize my thoughts:

**Scratchpad:**

1. **Parties**: Extract information from `` elements:
	* Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company
	* Equitable Distributors, LLC
2. **Offer and Acceptance**: Identify relevant details from XML document:
	* No explicit offer or acceptance information found; assume standard language for these sections.
3. **Agreement Details**:
	* May be executed in separate counters (XML document): Include this detail in the agreement.
4. **Limitation of Liability**:
	* Net limitation amount: Extract relevant details from `` element:
		+ Amount paid and to be paid: 12 months prior to first event that is subject of the first claim
5. **Schedule I**: Extract information from `` elements:
	* Wholesale Sales:
		- Initial sales: Sales support reclassification...
		- Corporate expenses:
			- Allocation driver: N/A
			- First year premium: Annual fixed percentage based on historical trends...
			- Annual fixed percentage: Sales support reclassification...

With these details, I will now reconstruct the contract text. Here is the final output:
