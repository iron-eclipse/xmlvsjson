You are tasked with converting the text of a legal contract into an XML format. Your goal is to create a structured XML representation that accurately captures the key elements and details of the original contract.

Examine the contract text provided below:

<contract>
{{CONTRACT}}
</contract>

To convert the contract into XML format, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the contract to identify its main components and structure.
2. Create an XML structure that reflects the hierarchical organization of the contract.
3. Include all relevant information from the contract, such as parties involved, dates, terms, conditions, and any specific clauses or provisions.
4. Use appropriate XML element names that clearly describe the content they contain.
5. Ensure that all important details, including names, dates, amounts, and specific legal language, are accurately captured.
6. Maintain the logical flow and structure of the original contract in your XML representation.

As you work through the conversion process, you may use a <scratchpad> to organize your thoughts and plan the structure of the XML. You can use this space to outline the main elements, note important details, or work out any complex relationships between elements.

When creating the XML:
- Use clear and descriptive element names.
- Nest elements as needed to represent the contract's structure.
- Use attributes where appropriate to provide additional information about elements.
- Include all relevant details from the original contract.
- Ensure that the XML structure allows for easy reconstruction of the original contract text.

Once you have completed the conversion, present the final XML document without any additional commentary or explanations. Enclose your entire XML output within <xml_output> tags.

Begin your conversion process now, using the <scratchpad> as needed, and provide the final XML representation as your output.
